Title: Get Foster Campbell Elected

Intro-text: 

Direct action Day 2 : Get Foster Campbell Elected to Louisiana Senate so we can tip Congress one vote further in our favor

Let's help Foster Campbell get elected to the Louisiana Senate. That means Dems will be 49-51 instead of 48-52, with a better chance to filibuster. The Louisiana runoff is December 10. Republicans are worried about this: they just opened 10 offices in Louisiana dedicated to Campbell's opponent's campaign.
