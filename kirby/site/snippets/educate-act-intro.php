		<p>Co-hosted by Hunter Artist Action Group [HAAG] of Hunter MFA and 2 Hours A Week, EDUCATE & ACT is a community organized skill & information sharing program.</p>

		<p>We are hosting a series of events aimed at empowering all of us to be better informed citizens and activists, with stronger voices and longterm stamina.</p>
		
		<p>Events will include teach-ins, panel discussions, self-care and movement workshops, performances, readings, screenings, letter writing and grassroots organizing. This is all made possible by the generosity of our peers and colleagues, who are donating their time, knowledge, and skills to help us together build a strong and aware community of resistance.</p>
