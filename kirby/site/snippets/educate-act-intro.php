		<p>EDUCATE & ACT is a series of events aimed at empowering us to be better informed citizens and activists, with stronger voices and greater stamina.</p> 

		<p>This program is cohosted by Hunter Artist Action Group (HAAG) of Hunter MFA and 2 Hours a Week. Events will include teach-ins, workshops, panels, performances, readings, discussions, seminars, screenings, letter writing, sign making, and grassroots organizing. They are made possible by the generosity of our peers and colleagues, who are donating their time, knowledge, and skills to help us together build a strong and aware community of resistance.</p>
