2 Hours a Week
==============

This is the website for 2 Hours a Week.

The 1.0 version of the site is in the root directory.

The 2.0 version is in the  `kirby/` folder.
The new site is currently built on top of Kirby, a simple flat file CMS: http://www.getkirby.com

As a development environment, use whatever you're comfortable with. I have been using MAMP: https://www.mamp.info/en/
To set up the environment using MAMP: 

* open MAMP 
* click 'Preferences' and go to the 'Apache Tab'
* click 'Select' below the 'Document Root' text field
* navigate to 2hoursaweek.org/kirby and confirm
* hit 'OK' and click 'Start Servers'

The data structure of an action is defined in the `kirby/site/blueprints/action.php` file in YAML.
The templates for each section are defined `kirby/site/snippets`.

Javascript and CSS folders are in `kirby/assets`.
